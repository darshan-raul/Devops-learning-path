# Devops-Learning-path


This is my attempt to compile all the various resources which are availble online to build a single curated list of all links and data regarding Devops

To keep things simple and straight forward, I am going to follow this single roadmap and then list out the resources/notes in that flow. All credits to the creator of the roadmap :)

**NOTE** Will try to be as brief as possible while defining anything. I want this list to be as comprehensive as possible with all things DevOps which essentially means that its invevitable its going to be long. So I will avoid going into more details than necessary for the concepts. Of course I will attach the best links explaining the topics in much depth.

Lets start!

# DevOps:

DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support.

It is a set of practices that automates the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. The concept of DevOps is founded on building a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in relative siloes. The promised benefits include increased trust, faster software releases, ability to solve critical issues quickly, and better manage unplanned work.


## Advantages of adopting DevOps:
- Collaboration and trust
- Release faster and work smarter
- Accelerate time to resolution
- Better manage unplanned work

## Task's of a DevOps Engineer:

Thereâ€™s no formal career track for becoming a DevOps engineer. They are either developers who get interested in deployment and network operations, or sysadmins who have a passion for scripting and coding, and move into the development side where they can improve the planning of test and deployment. Either way, these are people who have pushed beyond their defined areas of competence and who have a more holistic view of their technical environments

- Ability to use a wide variety of open source technologies and tools
- Ability to code and script
- Experience with systems and IT operations
- Comfort with with frequent, incremental code testing and deployment
- Strong grasp of automation tools
- Data management skills
- A strong focus on business outcomes
- Comfort with collaboration, open communication and reaching across functional borders

There are a lot of concepts in Devops eg:CI/CD etc but I donot want this one to be a textbook of sorts for that. Just gave a overview of it and rest
